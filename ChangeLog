  * Fixed Bug.
    - I did not make the place that I should run again.

jinbei3d (1.0.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Improved a part of the BOIDS algorithm
    Because there was concern at transaction speed,
    I made processing short in a BOIDS part.
    However, there was not the need by the improvement
    of the drawing part. thus I did a BOIDS part properly.
